# Mahdieh Ebrahimi

I'm an AI Expert and AI Researcher with a passion for advancing technology in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) from Alzahra University. My thesis focused on predicting circRNA-RBP binding using graph neural networks.

Currently, I work as an AI Expert and Researcher at Amesha, where I'm pursuing research initiatives, focusing on: developing novel architectures for multilingual large language models, and execute advanced prompt engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

I also serve as a lecturer in Computer Science at the Iranian Cambridge School, sharing my knowledge and experience with the next generation of AI enthusiasts.
